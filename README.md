# Shakespeare Sonnet Text Analysis

# Overview
This project performs exploratory text analysis on Shakespeare’s sonnets using a combination of custom Python tooling and interactive notebooks. The goal is to surface linguistic patterns, stylistic features, and structural trends within the corpus while keeping the analysis transparent and interpretable.

Rather than relying heavily on prebuilt NLP pipelines, the project emphasizes understanding the text through lightweight preprocessing, frequency analysis, and targeted exploration. This approach makes it easier to connect quantitative patterns back to the source material and reason about why those patterns appear.

# Potential Applications
Exploratory text analysis techniques like those used here are applicable to a wide range of document-driven problems, including literary analysis, content auditing, document summarization, and early-stage NLP research. The workflow is particularly useful when the goal is insight and interpretability rather than prediction.

This style of analysis also translates well to product and research contexts where understanding how language is used matters more than optimizing model performance.

# Key Concepts
- Text preprocessing and normalization  
- Tokenization and frequency analysis  
- Corpus-level pattern discovery  
- Exploratory NLP workflows  
- Interpretability-focused analysis
